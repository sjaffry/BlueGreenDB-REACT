# BlueGreenDB-REACT
This is a ReactUI for an experiment I'm running to assess if a blue/green deployment strategy can be applied to the database!


The backend code for this as well as the database is hosted on Azure App Service.


To run the UI locally via Node, just execute the run.sh command (you must have Babel cli installed)
